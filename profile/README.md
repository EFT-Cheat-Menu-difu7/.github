With this **EFT Cheat Menu**, you become the apex predator — wallhacks, aimbot, loot radar, no recoil, and a ton more, all controlled from one sleek in-game interface.

No need to run multiple sketchy tools — this cheat menu has **everything you need in one place**. Toggle, customize, dominate. Simple as that.
